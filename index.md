# Paradex XP OTC Trading Community - White Paper

## Overview

Our Paradex XP OTC Telegram community is a secure and manual Over-The-Counter trading platform for buying and selling Paradex XP points related to the upcoming airdrop. Built on transparency and trust, we facilitate safe OTC trades by acting as a trusted intermediary holding collateral until the airdrop.

## Why Paradex XP OTC?

üîê Simple Escrow via Admin Wallets
We use two separate wallets controlled by the admin:
- Fee Wallet: collects trading fees.
- Collateral Wallet: holds the funds until the airdrop conversion.

This manual setup ensures prompt and reliable transactions without the complexity of multisignature wallets.

üí∞ Fair & Transparent Fees

- 1.5% fee on the buyer‚Äôs collateral.
- 1.5% fee on the seller‚Äôs collateral.

Total fee is 3% per transaction.

For example, if you trade $1,000 worth of XP points, each party pays $15 in fees.

## How It Works

### Initiate Trade

Participants contact the admin via Telegram [@mnrbgn](https://t.me/mnrbgn) with trade details in this format:

Selling/Buying: XXX XP Points

Price: $ per point

### Deposit Collateral

Buyer deposits payment to the admin‚Äôs collateral wallet.

Seller deposits payment to the admin‚Äôs collateral wallet.

Both deposit 100% collateral to ensure security.

Deposit only USDC via Arbitrum.

### Verification

The admin verifies both deposits and confirms trade terms.

## Airdrop and Release

Once the Paradex protocol executes the airdrop and converts XP points to tokens, the seller should send $DIME tokens to the admin.
Once verified it releases tokens to the buyer and payment (minus fees) to the seller.

If the seller fails to uphold their end of the agreement ‚Äî such as not transferring tokens after TGE ‚Äî the buyer will receive both parties' collateral as compensation.

## Rules and Conditions

Fees are applied when placing or accepting bids/asks.

Fees are non-refundable if:

- A bid or ask is cancelled after being filled.

- Attempts to manipulate or misuse the trade process occur.

If a bid or ask is cancelled before being filled, a 48-hour waiting period is required before re-submitting.

Buyers may increase their bids; sellers may lower their asks, but the inverse is not allowed.

## Our Mission

The Paradex XP OTC community aims to create a trustworthy, transparent OTC marketplace that empowers users to safely trade XP points ahead of the official airdrop, strengthening the Paradex ecosystem.
